# The Hat-Trick

In sports, a hat-trick describes 3 positive feats in a single match. In PL, a hat-trick is a combination of three spectacular qualities in a single paper (main idea, writing, visuals, evaluation, polished presentation, etc.). The winner of the hat-trick is a paper that best captures this quality.

# Pearls Before Swine or Wine After Perl

Sometimes the best is from an outsider or the worst is from an insider. Expectations are meant to be subverted be it from without or within. For without the in you are without a doubt without a means to express an out. This award is for a paper that subverts insitutional boundaries and traditional ways people publish.


# The Hat-Trick

In sports, a hat-trick describes three positive feats in a single match. In PL, a hat-trick is a combination of three spectacular qualities in a single paper (main idea, writing, examples, visuals, evaluation, polished presentation, etc.). The winner of the hat-trick is a paper that best captures this quality.

# Who Woulda Thunk It

Imagine yourself at your desk, head in your hands after what seemed like an eternity of brainstorming and problem-solving, only to realize that the solution to your problem was incredibly simple. This award is for the paper that best captures this feeling, that is, proposes a surprisingly simple solution to a problem that seems utterly massive in scale.

# :construction:[UNDER CONSTRUCTION]:construction:

This award is for the paper that, however promising the contents are, feels unfinished and somewhat half-baked, as if the ideas and concepts within are still under construction.

# An Experience Like No Other

For a paper that _most feels like_ it could have come from Augusta University.

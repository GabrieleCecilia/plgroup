Abstract The Knuth–Morris–Pratt (KMP) algorithm for string search is notoriously difficult to understand. Lost in a sea of index arithmetic, most explanations of KMP obscure its essence. This paper constructs KMP incrementally, using pictures to illustrate each step. The end result is easier to comprehend. Additionally, the derivation uses only elementary functional programming techniques.

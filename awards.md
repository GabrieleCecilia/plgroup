**Art is not what you see, but what you make others see**

Think of the traditional saying: a picture is worth a thousand words. The best visuals are not just decorative illustrations, but add exhilarating twists and captivating details to the reading experience, and enhance the reader's understanding of the story. This award recognizes the paper that best leverages the power of visual storytelling to show to the reader the world that the authors wishes for them to see.

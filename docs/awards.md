# PL Reading Group Awards

## Award Categories

**The Great Teacher Inspires**

With dense figures, symbols, syntax, and semantics, PL research is revered for its traditions and high standards. This sometimes makes papers look intimidating to novice students.
This award recognizes a publication for presenting a rigorous technical contribution, while also including aspects of teaching to make the topic accessible to junior community members.

**The Rolex**

The famous Swiss watch is a symbol of quality, precision, durability and elegance.
Just like its namesake, this award recognizes a publication for its refinement and expertise in artisanship and careful perfection of details.

#### New Awards Procedure (Fall 2024)

At the end of the semester, each participant nominates any number
of papers which they believe should receive an award.
Additionally, for each paper nominated, the participant picks *two* papers
they believe should *not receive awards*.

The awards gala, then consists of arguing if the nominated papers
should receive awards, and coming up with funny award names for the winners.

## Fall 2025 Award Categories

#### Statue of Liberty

The Statue of Liberty is rich in symbolism.
The symbols collectively convey the message of freedom, democracy,
and hope for a better world.
This award goes to the paper that best represents the spirit of enlightenment
and the path to a brighter future.

#### The Key to My Soul

Some artpieces leave a lasting impression on the viewer.
They may leave you inspired to action, enchanted by their beauty,
humbled at the sheer skill that went into their creation,
or vexed with a message not yet fully clear to you.
Papers are much like art pieces in this regard, and this award
is for the paper that will stick with you for a very long timeâ€”the
one you will be telling your grandchildren about.

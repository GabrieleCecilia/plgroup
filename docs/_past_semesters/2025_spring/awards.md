## Award Categories

#### Through the Looking Glass
Bestowed upon works that reveal a world beyond the mirror, where conventional views are turned upside down. This award celebrates papers that lead to unexpected realms of thought, turning the ordinary into the extraordinary and reshaping familiar landscapes into realms of wonder.
<br/>**Winner:** Knuth–Morris–Pratt illustrated

#### The Librarian
This award is for the paper that, like a librarian, shows unmatched dedication to their bookkeeping and organization of resources. Specifically, this is for the paper with the most comprehensive, well-formatted, and organized paper of the semester.
<br/>**Winner:** Choral: Object-oriented Choreographic Programming

#### The Hat-Trick
In sports, a hat-trick describes three positive feats in a single match. In PL, a hat-trick is a combination of three spectacular qualities in a single paper (main idea, writing, examples, visuals, evaluation, polished presentation, etc.). The winner of the hat-trick is a paper that best captures this quality.
<br/>**Winner.** Decidable Subtyping of Existential Types for Julia

#### Homework Required
This award is for a paper that is very understandable and readable at first glance, before suddenly blindsiding you with the necessity to read thousands of papers of background to understand anything.
<br/>**Winner.** Message-Observing Sessions

#### The Lemon
What a sight to behold! So futuristic, so sleek, so- wait... the gas tank is in the trunk, the accelerator pedal gets stuck to the floor, and a sheets of steel are flying off?! This award is meant for a paper that, while impressive on initial observation, quite literally falls apart upon further reading.
<br/>**Winner.** The Ultimate Conditional Syntax

#### The Catalyst
The best papers are the ones that provoke deep thought on a topic, but why not provoke violent, aggressive discussion as well? This award goes to the paper that was the most controversial for the group. That is, this award goes to the paper that sparked the most heated debate amongst our members, almost certainly resulting in the arguing shifting from the paper to topics loosely connected to it.
<br/>**Winner.** Staged Compilation with Module Functors

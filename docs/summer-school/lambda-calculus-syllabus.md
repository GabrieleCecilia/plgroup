# Lambda Calculus Curriculum

## Week 1-2: Basics

- Introduction to Lambda Calculus: Basic understanding of mathematical logic and computation theory.
- Syntax and Conventions: Familiarity with mathematical notation and basic set theory.
- Variable Representation Schemes: Introduction to DeBruijn indexing, global names, and other variable representation schemes.
- Alpha Conversion: Understanding of syntax and conventions in lambda calculus.
- Beta Reduction and Reduction Order: Understanding of alpha conversion, basic lambda calculus operations, and reduction strategies (normal, applicative, etc.).
- Call-by-Name and Call-by-Value: Understanding of these evaluation strategies in lambda calculus.

## Week 3-4: Not so basics

- Church Encoding: Understanding of basic lambda calculus operations and principles. Introduction to if/else expressions in the context of Church encoding.
- Combinators: Introduction to the canonical combinators S, K, I, and the Y combinator for recursion.
- Eta Conversion: Understanding of basic lambda calculus operations.
- Proof of Turing Completeness: Understanding of the concept of Turing completeness and how it applies to lambda calculus.

## Week 5-6: Approaching Programming

- Typed Lambda Calculus: Introduction to typed lambda calculus, building on the untyped version learned previously.
- Implementations in Haskell, CAML, Lisp, etc.: Understanding of a functional programming language and lambda calculus.

## Week 7-8: Advanced Things

- Continuation Passing Style (CPS): Understanding of lambda calculus in programming and basic control flow concepts.
- Advanced Encodings: Exploration of more efficient encoding schemes beyond Church encoding.
- Connections with Category Theory and Logic: Understanding of basic category theory concepts, formal logic systems, and lambda calculus.

Hi all! Welcome to the Fall 2025 semester of Delta Lambda Delta PL Reading Group. 
I just wanted to open the semester with a couple of announcements concerning the 
reading group before our first meeting.

### Reminder of Officer Duties:

President - The President presides over the weekly and ensures any organizational 
requirements from the Student Org dept. are met.

Vice President - The VP's main role is presiding over weekly meetings in the event 
that the President is absent, as well as any duties given by the President.

Treasurer - The Treasurer's primary responsibilities consist of obtaining/utilizing/
reporting use of funding for events led by us.

Secretary - The secretary shall keep track of attendance, make events in Presence, 
and update members through the various channels we use of upcoming events and other 
relevant information.

### Paper Selection

Over the summer, Peter has worked on updating the bot used to select papers from other 
conferences, rather than just the four ACM SIGPLAN conferences we've been pulling from 
in the past. If you haven't already, you can add your own favorite conference (as long 
as it's on DBLP) by following [our previous blog post.](https://the-au-forml-lab.github.io/plgroup/2025/08/01/looking-for-conferences.html)

### New Debate System

As decided at the Spring 2025 Awards Gala, we shall employ a new system to encourage 
debate. Specifically, each week, there will be one Defendant and one Plaintiff assigned 
to the paper being read, in which their goals are to defend or prosecute the paper. The 
debaters shall be selected at random at the end of each meeting, with the previous 
debaters being excluded from the pool. As a reminder, failure to adequately debate 
your assigned point-of-view results in a sanction in the form of forcing said debater 
to continue to be in their role until they sufficiently serve it.

### Paper Award Categories

As decided at the Spring 2025 Awards Gala, we shall revert back to the old system of 
paper award selection, such that we will pick the award categories at the first meeting. 
As such, each member must come to this week's meeting with exactly one award category, 
in which we will vote on the ones to be used for the Fall 2025 Awards Gala.

### Neea Rusch, PhD

As observed on Friday, August 15th, 2025, one of our founding members, Neea Rusch, 
successfully defended her PhD dissertation among her committee and a panel of her peers! 
We wish her the best as she wraps up the final steps of her program and enters the next 
chapter beyond her program.

That's all for now! I shall see you at our first meeting this Friday!

~ Jason Weeks, Secretary
